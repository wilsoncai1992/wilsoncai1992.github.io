I am a second year Ph.D. student in [Biostatistics](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/biostat) at [UC Berkeley](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/). I am fortunate to be advised by Professors [Mark van der Laan](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~laan/) and [Alan Hubbard](http://hubbard.berkeley.edu/). My research interests lie in **Statistical Machine Learning** and **Causal Inference**. 

I graduated from [the Univeristy of Hong Kong](http://hku.hk) with a B.Sc. (Honors) in [Statistics](http://www.saasweb.hku.hk/) and double major in [Finance](http://fbe.hku.hk/). I was awarded the [Saw Gold Medal in Statistics](http://www.saasweb.hku.hk/programme/scholarship.php) (magna cum laude) and [Undergraduate Research Fellowship](http://tl.hku.hk/urfp/) during my graduation at HKU.

Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I was a visiting researcher at [UC Davis](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/) working with [Prabir Burman](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~burman/). I also worked under the able guidance of [Prof. Alexander Aue](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~alexaue/) and [Prof. Debashis Paul](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~debashis/).


Here is the latest version of my [CV](link).
